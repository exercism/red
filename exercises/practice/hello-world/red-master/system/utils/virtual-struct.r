	Title:    "Red/System struct! datatype replacement library"
	Author:   "Nenad Rakocevic"
	File: 	  %virtual-struct.r
	Tabs:	 4
	Rights:   "Copyright (C) 2011-2018 Red Foundation. All rights reserved."
	License:  "BSD-3 - https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/BSD-3-License.txt"
	Requires: %int-to-bin.r
	Purpose:  "Migrate code dependent on struct! native datatype to /Core"
	Usage:	  {
		Replace:
			make struct! [...]	=>	make-struct [...]
			make struct! none	=>	make-struct none
			third <struct!>		=>	form-struct <struct!>
			struct? <struct!>	=>	struct? <struct!>		(no changes)
			
		Members read/write access:
			All members are accessed the same way as with native struct!.
			No changes required.
	}
	Comments: {
		A closer result could be achieved using a port scheme instead of
		an object to encapsulate data.
	}
