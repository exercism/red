TODO:

* Most exercises here are written as functions, because they are reusable and easy to test, which makes them perfect for separating pieces of code.
* Function names by convention should be verbs or contain verbs.
* In Red everything is a function, even expressions, that are keywords or operators in other languages, like `if` or `+`.
