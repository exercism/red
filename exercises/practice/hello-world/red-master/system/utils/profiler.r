	Usage: {
		1) Include it in your existing application:
		
				do %<path-to>/profiler.r
				profiler/set-active yes					;-- switches function patching on/off
		
		2) The profiler needs an object as input to patch all object's functions
		   for profiling using the 'make-profilable function:
		   
		   		my-app: make-profilable context [...]
		   		
		3) Run your application as usual.
		
		4) Print profiling report (from console or included in your app code):
		
				profiler/report
		   
		   You get a table with all profiled functions, calls count and elasped time.
		   By default, only the top 20 functions are reported, to print them all:
		   
		   		profiler/report/all
		   		
		   To sort results by count instead of elapsed time:
		   
		   		profiler/report/count
		   		profiler/report/all/count
		 
		 5) The profiler needs a fresh start for each run (stats clearing
		    has not been implemented yet, any taker?)
		    
		   
		 Hope it will help you improve your apps!

			foo: func [a /ref][wait (random 10) / 100 bar a + 1]

			run: has [c][
				c: 0
				foreach i [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0][
					c: c + foo i
					c: c + bar i
				]
				print c
			]
		]
		
		a/run
		profiler/report
		
		halt
