Building Red binaries
------------------------

_Note: This is **not** required to build or run red from sources. It is for a feature used by the red team. Check the [main readme](/README.md#running-red-from-the-sources-for-contributors) if you want to build red from sources_

_Prerequisite_

_You need a [Rebol SDK](http://www.rebol.com/sdk.html) copy with a valid license file in order to rebuild the Red binary, this is a constraint from using Rebol2 for the bootstrapping. Once selfhosted, Red will not have such constraint._

In order to build a Red binary:

1. Place a copy of one of the [encappers](http://www.rebol.com/docs/sdk/kernels.html) ( **enpro** would be a right choice) along with a copy of **license.key** file into the **%build/** folder.

2. Make a copy of **encap-paths.r.sample** file and name it **encap-paths.r**.

3. Edit **encap-paths.r** file and adjust the paths to your Rebol SDK folders.

4. Open a Rebol console, and CD to the **%build/** folder.

        >> change-dir %<path-to-Red>/build/

5. Run the build script from the console:

        >> do %build.r
        
6. After a few seconds, a new **red** binary will be available in the **build/bin/** folder.

7. Enjoy!
